I am a software developer at AFRY, where I contribute to the development,
maintenance, and enhancement of software solutions. With a particular focus
on geospatial data and smart forestry. As a software developer, I value
simple, decoupled, and modular architectures, reproducible results, and
automating as much of the development as possible.
